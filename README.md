## Setup

First, install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install

#or

pnpm i
```

After installing:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

to run the project.

You need to wait a moment the first time you run the project, otherwise the project will encounter some issues due to insufficient loading. After full loading, no problems will occur.
