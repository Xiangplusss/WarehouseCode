First, install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install

#or

pnpm i
```

After installing:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

to run the project. The project will run on localhost:3000, Make sure the port is not occupied. Otherwise the project will not run.

You need to wait a moment the first time you run the project, otherwise the project will encounter some issues due to insufficient loading. After full loading, no problems will occur.

If you have any problems, you can send email to me directly: xli22@student.oulu.fi(university email, but I recommend send to personal email, because I may mistake it as an advertisement),  shawnlee0803@163.com(personal email).
